# Juliana Azevedo - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About me
Hey there! I’m Juliana, and I’m diving into the world of data analysis. With my background in engineering, I’m currently wrapping up my Data Analyst certificates, and I’ve built a solid foundation in life sciences. I’m super excited to put my analytical and technical skills to use in a data analyst role, even if it’s at the entry-level.

Throughout my studies, I’ve become pretty good at working with complex data and spotting patterns and trends. I’ve also gained hands-on experience with lab techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I think will really come in handy as a data analyst.

In my free time, I love checking out new data analysis tools and techniques, and I’m always eager to learn more. Whether I’m collaborating with a team or tackling something solo, I’m driven by the excitement of uncovering new insights and the joy of using data to solve tricky problems.

Oh, and I’ve got a link to my CV in PDF 

Plus a repository where I showcase my skills, share projects, and keep track of my progress in Data Analytics.
